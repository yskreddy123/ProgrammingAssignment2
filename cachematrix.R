# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
             m <- NULL
             set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
             }
	     get <- function() x
             setInverse <- function(Inverse) m <<- Inverse
             getInverse <- function() m
             list(set = set, get = get,
                  setInverse = setInverse,
                  getInverse = getInverse)
}


# The following function returns the inverse of the matrix. It first checks if
# the inverse has already been computed. If so, it gets the result and skips the
# computation. If not, it computes the inverse, sets the value in the cache via
# setinverse function.

# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

	m <- x$getInverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setInverse(m)
        m
